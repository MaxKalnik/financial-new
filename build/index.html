The question follows: how, then, can consumers determine with which bank it is best to open an account, obtain a credit card, or sign a mortgage? Which will sustain you, and which will drain you?</p><p class="main-text">To answer this question, RewardExpert analyzed consumer complaint data from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau for four categories: bank accounts, credit cards, mortgages, and loans. Knowing full well that the answer would vary from place to place, we organized the data geographically using regions defined by the first three-digit zip code. Using GIS software to visualize this data as a map we noticed more geographical patterns and disparities than we expected to find.</p><p class="main-text">In this first installment of a three-part series, we will identify the best and worst banks and financial institutions across the country, as well as the most striking geographical disparity that can be seen on the national level: either rural and urban America are not being treated equally by financial institutions, or else there are cultural, dispositional, or even political reasons to explain the sharp difference in complaints between the two.</p></div><div class="text-box text-box--purple text-box--worst"><h2 class="block-title">The Top Five Worst Financial Institutions</h2><div class="info-text">Even though our analysis was designed to be fair and even-handed to all financial institutions regardless of size, using the ratio of consumer complaints per capita, adjusted for total domestic bank assets, three of the top five receiving the most complaints are also among the top five banks in the U.S. by assets. The other two, however, are quite small and specialized by comparison.</div><div class="bank-ranking"><div class="bank-ranking__item"><div class="bank-ranking__header"><div class="bank-ranking__header-text"><img src="images/svg/n-one-red.svg" class="bank-ranking__num"><h3 class="bank-ranking__title">Ocwen Loan Servicing</h3></div><p class="bank-ranking__under-title"><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">#1 For Credit Card Complaints</span></p></div><p class="bank-ranking__text">Ocwen Loan Servicing is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ocwen Financial, the fourth-largest servicer of subprime mortgage loans in the country. Ocwen takes first place on our list for its extraordinarily high rate of consumer complaints about its business practices on both a per-capita basis, and even more so in relation to its total domestic assets of $7.92 billion. With a total of <span class="semibold">24,385 complaints </span>filed with the CFPB, this amounts to a little more than three complaints for every million dollars of Ocwen’s assets (for reference, the second highest complaint/asset ratio of all financial institutions is 0.1348 per million for American Express). In 2013 Ocwen was sued by the CFPB and 49 states for mortgage servicing misconduct, and signed a consent order agreeing to a $2.1 billion settlement. Ocwen’s complaints are clustered in the suburban/exurban regions surrounding most major cities, with an additional hot spot covering the entire state of Colorado.</p><div class="bank-ranking__logo-container"><div class="bank-ranking__logo"><img src="images/banks/ocwen.png" srcset="images/banks/ocwen@2x.png 2x" width="57" class="bank-ranking__logo-img"></div></div></div><div class="bank-ranking__item"><div class="bank-ranking__header"><div class="bank-ranking__header-text"><img src="images/svg/n-two-red.svg" class="bank-ranking__num"><h3 class="bank-ranking__title">Bank of America Springs</h3></div><p class="bank-ranking__under-title"><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">#1 For Bank Accounts Complaints</span><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">#4 For Credit Cards Complaints</span><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">#2 For Mortgage Loans Complaints</span></p></div><p class="bank-ranking__text">While Bank of America has the highest number of consumer complaints across the country in total, as well as for both checking/savings accounts and mortgage loans, this is mitigated – slightly – by its large size and $170.5 billion in assets (third-largest bank by assets). Bank of America’s role in subprime mortgage lending is well-known, and as such it is not surprising that in this category it is second only to Ocwen in complaints. Bank of America’s terms, conditions, fees, and policies concerning checking and savings accounts are what secures their place on this list. Highlights (or rather lowlights) include high overdraft fees, as well as a policy of processing transactions in such an order as to maximize the incidence of overdrafts, and <span class="semibold">charging overdraft fees for overdrafts caused by overdraft fees. </span>Geographically speaking, Bank of America receives complaints everywhere, with especially high rates being seen in cities and suburbs, as well as throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Pacific Coast regions.</p><div class="bank-ranking__logo-container"><div class="bank-ranking__logo"><img src="images/banks/b-of-america.png" srcset="images/banks/b-of-america@2x.png 2x" width="84" class="bank-ranking__logo-img"></div></div></div><div class="bank-ranking__item"><div class="bank-ranking__header"><div class="bank-ranking__header-text"><img src="images/svg/n-three-red.svg" class="bank-ranking__num"><h3 class="bank-ranking__title">Wells Fargo</h3></div><p class="bank-ranking__under-title"><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">#2 For Bank Accounts Complaints</span><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">#8 For Credit Cards Complaints</span><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">#3 For Mortgage Loans Complaints</span></p></div><p class="bank-ranking__text">Say what you will about accounts with Bank of America; at least they were most likely opened with the customer’s authorization and knowledge. It is possible that, in the aftermath of <span class="semibold">the unauthorized account scandal that exposed many deceptive and downright vampiric business practices </span>at Wells Fargo (for which the company was fined $185 million), the rate of complaints might well understate the issue. These aggressive and unauthorized sales tactics affected consumers of all types of financial products, as employees were encouraged to maximize the number of various accounts held by customers. Accordingly, Wells Fargo has high rates of consumer complaints across the board. In terms of geographical distribution, we found high rates of complaints everywhere except for New England and upstate New York, and a wide swath of territory extending through Appalachia and the lower Midwest to Oklahoma and Louisiana.</p><div class="bank-ranking__logo-container"><div class="bank-ranking__logo"><img src="images/banks/wells-fargo.png" srcset="images/banks/wells-fargo@2x.png 2x" width="48" class="bank-ranking__logo-img"></div></div></div><div class="bank-ranking__item"><div class="bank-ranking__header"><div class="bank-ranking__header-text"><img src="images/svg/n-four-red.svg" class="bank-ranking__num"><h3 class="bank-ranking__title">Synchrony Financial</h3></div><p class="bank-ranking__under-title"><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">#3 For Credit Cards (Private Label) Complaints</span></p></div><p class="bank-ranking__text">Synchrony Financial is one of the worst banks that you might not recognize, even if you have a credit card provided by them. This is because Synchrony specializes in private label credit cards, for brands such as Amazon, Walmart, Lowe’s, BP, J.C. Penney, among others, controlling 42% of the private label card market. In 2014, Synchrony settled with the CFPB for <span class="semibold">$225 million in a consent decree for “deceptive and discriminatory practices.” </span>The company was found to have engaged in discrimination against its Hispanic/Spanish-speaking customers by not offering certain promotions, and there is clear evidence in support of such practices in the geographical distribution of complaints. Almost every sizable, ethnically diverse city outside of New England had high per-capita rates of complaints, and diverse states such as Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware saw high rates statewide. This suggests that Synchrony was only held accountable for one among many of their 'deceptive and discriminatory practices. Across the country, Synchrony Financial has the fourth highest rate of complaints per million dollars it holds in assets, at 0.125 complaints per million.</p><div class="bank-ranking__logo-container"><div class="bank-ranking__logo"><img src="images/banks/synchrony.png" srcset="images/banks/synchrony@2x.png 2x" width="110" class="bank-ranking__logo-img"></div></div></div><div class="bank-ranking__item"><div class="bank-ranking__header"><div class="bank-ranking__header-text"><img src="images/svg/n-five-red.svg" class="bank-ranking__num"><h3 class="bank-ranking__title">Citibank</h3></div><p class="bank-ranking__under-title"><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">#1 For Credit Cards Complaints</span><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">#4 For Bank Accounts Complaints</span><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">#5 For Mortgage Loans Complaints</span></p></div><p class="bank-ranking__text">Rounding out our list is Citibank, which carries the dubious distinction of <span class="semibold">receiving the most complaints about its credit cards, </span>both absolutely and on a per-capita basis. Citibank lives up to its name, with virtually every large or mid-size city in the country being a complaint hot spot; the few exceptions including Providence, RI; Hartford, CT; Nashville, TN; Fargo, ND; Spokane, WA; and the Missouri side of Kansas City. The pattern is similar with checking/savings accounts and mortgage loans, with an even greater urban concentration in the former, and somewhat less in the latter. If you live in a major city or a nearby suburban county, Citibank may not be for you.</p><div class="bank-ranking__logo-container"><div class="bank-ranking__logo"><img src="images/banks/citibank.png" srcset="images/banks/citibank@2x.png 2x" width="83" class="bank-ranking__logo-img"></div></div></div></div><div class="tables-container"><div class="mobile-only"><table class="ranking-table ranking-table--fixed"><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Bank</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Bank of America, N.A.</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Wells Fargo & Company</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Synchrony Financial</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Citibank, N.A.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="ranking-table__wrapper"><table class="ranking-table ranking-table--data"><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Bank</th><th>Total Complaints</th><th>% All Complaints</th><th>Credit Card Complaints</th><th>CC Rank</th><th>Account Complaints</th><th>Account Complaint Rank</th><th>Mortgage Complaints</th><th>Mortgage Rank</th><th>Complaints/Assets</th><th>Total Assets</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC</td><td>24,487</td><td>6.7</td><td>6</td><td>34</td><td>62</td><td>65</td><td>24,385</td><td>1</td><td>3.0871</td><td>$7,932m</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Bank of America, N.A.</td><td>66,823</td><td>18.3</td><td>9861</td><td>14</td><td>15229</td><td>1</td><td>40,880</td><td>2</td><td>0.04146</td><td>$1,705,928m</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Wells Fargo & Company</td><td>55,193</td><td>15.1</td><td>4466</td><td>20</td><td>14415</td><td>2</td><td>32,112</td><td>3</td><td>0.03298</td><td>$1,731,937m</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Synchrony Financial</td><td>11,311</td><td>3.1</td><td>9569</td><td>3</td><td>779</td><td>26</td><td>204</td><td>17</td><td>0.12539</td><td>$90,207m</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Citibank, N.A.</td><td>33,503</td><td>9.2</td><td>18219</td><td>8</td><td>4766</td><td>4</td><td>9,088</td><td>5</td><td>0.03936</td><td>$1,401,303m</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="btn-container"><a href="/overall-ranking.html" class="btn-table"><span class="btn-table__text">Click here to see the full national ranking</span></a></div></div><div class="text-box text-box--green text-box--worst"><h2 class="block-title">Best Small & Regional Banks</h2><div class="info-text">Not surprisingly, every financial institution at the top of our list with track records of good business practices and customer satisfaction is a smaller, regional bank (with assets ranging from $14 billion to $80 billion).</div><div class="bank-ranking"><div class="bank-ranking__item"><div class="bank-ranking__header"><div class="bank-ranking__header-text"><img src="images/svg/n-one-green.svg" class="bank-ranking__num"><h3 class="bank-ranking__title">Bank of the Ozarks</h3></div><p class="bank-ranking__under-title"><span class="bank-ranking__under-title-text">Branches in: AR, TX, GA, NC, SC, AL, FL, CA, NY</span></p></div><p class="bank-ranking__text">At the top of our list is Arkansas-based Bank of the Ozarks, with an impressive record of <span class="semibold">only one consumer complaint received </span>and recorded by the CFPB.

BBVA Compass is the 30th largest bank in the US, with 688 branches and $83.9 billion in assets. BBVA has a complaint rate only slightly higher than our last entry, 0.02 per million in assets, with even lower rates for its mortgage, loan, and credit products. While BBVA has received more complaints for its checking and savings accounts, it is worth noting that it is one of the few major US banks that does not participate in Chexsystems, which makes it a good option for those who have been burned by other banks and otherwise unable to open a checking account due to their account history.</p><div class="bank-ranking__logo-container"><div class="bank-ranking__logo"><img src="images/banks/bbva.png" srcset="images/banks/bbva@2x.png 2x" width="84" class="bank-ranking__logo-img"></div></div></div></div><div class="tables-container"><div class="mobile-only"><table class="ranking-table ranking-table--fixed"><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Bank</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>MUFG Union Bank, N.A.</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Bank of the West</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>BMO Harris Bank, N.A.</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Huntington National Bank</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>BBVA Compass, Financial Corporation</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="ranking-table__wrapper"><table class="ranking-table ranking-table--data"><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Bank</th><th>Total Complaints</th><th>% All Complaints</th><th>Credit Card Complaints</th><th>CC Rank</th><th>Account Complaints</th><th>Account Complaint Rank</th><th>Mortgage Complaints</th><th>Mortgage Rank</th><th>Complaints/Assets</th><th>Total Assets</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>MUFG Union Bank, N.A.</td><td>571</td><td>0.15651</td><td>21</td><td>54</td><td>419</td><td>31</td><td>118</td><td>47</td><td>0.004899</td><td>$116,715m</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Bank of the West</td><td>793</td><td>0.21736</td><td>50</td><td>42</td><td>494</td><td>28</td><td>129</td><td>38</td><td>0.009124</td><td>$86,911m</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>BMO Harris Bank, N.A.</td><td>1037</td><td>0.28424</td><td>104</td><td>31</td><td>434</td><td>30</td><td>405</td><td>28</td><td>0.009765</td><td>$106,192m</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Huntington National Bank</td><td>1873</td><td>0.500655</td><td>72</td><td>35</td><td>1141</td><td>22</td><td>451</td><td>24</td><td>0.018493</td><td>$101,280m</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>BBVA Compass, Financial Corporation</td><td>1758</td><td>0.48187</td><td>190</td><td>22</td><td>1139</td><td>17</td><td>313</td><td>26</td><td>0.020941</td><td>$83,947m</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="btn-container"><a href="/overall-ranking.html" class="btn-table"><span class="btn-table__text">Click here to see the full national ranking</span></a></div></div><div class="text-box text-box--map"><h2 class="block-title">Geographical Observations</h2><p class="main-text js-before-table">Both in the aggregate and broken down by financial product, we have seen with only a few exceptions to a pattern where cities and suburbs, as well as densely populated and ethnically/economically diverse regions exhibit higher rates of consumer complaints, even after adjusting for population.

We calculated a weighted average of violent and nonviolent crimes (80-20), modified to give additional weight to rates of more serious crime, i.e. homicide, rape, and arson. We then excluded places with fewer than 3,000 inhabitants for reasons of statistical significance (the locations with both the highest and lowest incidence of violent and non-violent crime were places with populations < 10 people).</p><p class="main-text">We used GIS (Geographical Information Systems) data provided by the US Census bureau and analyzed data sets provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (Superfund/Brownfields sites, Toxic Release Inventory, and public institution structure points (hospitals and emergency/law enforcement facilities)), FEMA (Flood Loss & Emergency Response), NOAA (Tornado injuries/fatalities & economic damage), the USDOT (Fatal Crash Reporting System), annual daily traffic counts from Kalibrate, and foreclosure and mortgage delinquency rates as of May 2017 from CoreLogic. We also included various indicators from the CDC County Health Ratings and Roadmap data from March of 2017, including premature mortality rates by type, and other public health related indicators. Finally, we tallied the number of fatal workplace accidents recorded by OSHA, the number of ATF licensed firearms dealers by location or zip code.</p><p class="main-text">We then calculated weighted percentile rankings for each set of indicators, which were then combined with the weighted average of violent and non-violent crime rates from the FBI CUIS statistics, to produce a final composite risk score.</p></div></div><div class="methodology-source"><p class="main-text"><span class="semibold">Sources: </span>Consumer Complaints (CFPB), 3-Digit Zip Code Areas (Census Bureau), Large Commercial Banks (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/lbr/current/" target="_blank">Federal Reserve</a>).</p></div><div class="methodology-brands"><img src="images/brand_logo/cfpb.png" srcset="images/brand_logo/cfpb@2x.png 2x" class="methodology-brands__img"><img src="images/brand_logo/census.png" srcset="images/brand_logo/census@2x.png 2x" class="methodology-brands__img"><img src="images/brand_logo/federal-reserve.png" srcset="images/brand_logo/federal-reserve@2x.png 2x" class="methodology-brands__img"></div></div><section class="related"><div class="related-head"><h3 class="related-title">Credit cards you may like</h3><img inline="" src="images/svg/icon-wallet.svg" alt="" data-no-retina="true"></div><div class="related-list"><div class="col"><div class="related-item"><p class="related-item__title">Best Travel Credit Cards 2017</p><p class="related-item__text">Credit Cards that offer large bonus at sign up after meeting a minimum
