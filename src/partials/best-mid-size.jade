        | Second on our list is Bank of the West, which is based in California and has over 600 branches and offices across 20 states in the Midwest, Mountain West, and Pacific Coast regions. Like UnionBank, CIBC, and City National, Bank of the West is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a foreign banking corporation, Paris-based BNP Paribas.

        span.semibold  $86.9 billion in assets 
        | which makes for an impressively low rate of 0.00912 complaints per million. The vast majority of these have concerned checking/savings accounts and loans, with an extraordinarily low number of complaints about credit cards issued by the bank of only 50 in total.

        | Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, one of the largest banks in the Midwest (over 600 branches and 1,300 ATMs) and 26th largest in the country, comes in at third on our list. The bank has received 
        span.semibold comparably low rates of consumer complaints, 
        | which are even lower when taken in the context of its $106 billion in assets (a rate only slightly higher than Bank of the West, at 0.0098 per million). Like Bank of the West, BMO Harris performs best on credit cards.

        | Huntington National Bank is only slightly smaller than BMO Harris, with $101 billion in assets, and likewise 
        span.semibold relatively few complaints 
        | it issues. In fact, on this metric Huntington does even better, but its average rating suffers from a higher rate of complaints concerning its retail bank accounts. Nevertheless, for a bank of this size, 0.018 complaints per million in assets is an unusually low rate.

        | Completing our list is yet another US bank owned as a subsidiary by a foreign financial firm, BBVA Compass, owned by the Spanish multinational corporation Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria. BBVA Compass is the 30th largest bank in the US, with 688 branches and $83.9 billion in assets. BBVA has a complaint rate only slightly higher than our last entry, 0.02 per million in assets, with even lower rates for its mortgage, loan, and credit products. While BBVA has received more complaints for its checking and savings accounts, it is worth noting that it is one of the few major US banks that does not participate in Chexsystems, which makes it a good option for those who have been burned by other banks and otherwise unable to open a checking account due to their account history.
