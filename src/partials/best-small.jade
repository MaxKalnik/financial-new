        | While there has been some controversy over the fact that First Republic Bank caters toward a wealthier, whiter clientele, this has not prevented it from maintaining an exceptionally good track record of customer satisfaction and 
        span.semibold relatively few complaints 
        | for a bank of its size ($80 billion in assets). In fact, it may help: it may be in this case better to make few loans to lower-income and minority borrowers than to market substandard and/or predatory financial products to them.
